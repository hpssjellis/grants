**Project:**

Helium Arduino Portenta Lora Vision Shield Sensor Actuator Machine Learning Tutorials for Non-Engineers.md





**Elevator Pitch:**

The Helium People's Network needs everyday people to be able to use both the Hotspots and their own Devices. Machine Learning on Edge Devices fits perfectly with the Helium 
Network low bandwidth and low power consumption, but presently only big companies with Mechatronic Engineers using ESP32's are able to create products that effectively use HNT.
I believe the networks success is centered on everybody being able to make TinyML solutions for their family and small business needs. The simplicity of the Arduino products is 
legendary and the Portenta is the most powerful dual core microcontroller Arduino has produced with Vision, microphone LoRaWan shields it is the perfect choice for the
technology capable average Helium Hotspot owner.

I have the unique ability to simplify conplex technology and the teaching experience to create base set of tutorials to be able to allow anyone to use the Helium Network 
to it's full potential.

**Project Details:**

We expect a clearly articulated final deliverable for the project.

If the project utilizes legacy or other codebases, please specify this and link to applicable repos. In addition list any specific IP licenses you are utilizing. 

Where relevant, please include mockups/designs of any UI/hardware components, and API specifications of the core functionality.

It is often helpful to include an overview of the tech stack to be used, including any required dependencies. Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture or schematics to be deployed within or as the MVP is even better.





**Roadmap:**

| Milestone + Date | Deliverable | Summary | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones.

Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the expected functionality and how it can be validated.

Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered. The level of detail must be enough to later verify that the project meets the specification.

_MS/Roadmap EXAMPLE:_

| Milestone + Date | Deliverable | Summary | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MS1, Date | Figma UI/UX | A figma ui/ux full tech stack defined, we estimate 40 developer hours | 5,000 USD |
| MS2, Date | On-chain functionality | Core features implemented on-chain and deployed to HNT testnet, estimated at 20 developer hours | 2500 USD |
| MS3, Date | MVP | -Docker delivered to the DeWi foundation for mainnet testing. - repo is public - A Medium article and tutorial written on how to implement the new add-on which is published and linked in discord and forums, estimated at 25 core team hours | 2750 USD |
