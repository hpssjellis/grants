March- May 2021: research LoRa and LoRaWan abilities for the Arduino Portenta Pro LoRa Vision Shield.

July 2021: Start Helium Version of Project
Aug 2021: 
Fall 2021: Testing an updating of software

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones.

Milestones

For each milestone, please describe:
- The functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the specification you outlined in the Deliverables.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)

## Budget

Sum up the total requested budget across all milestones, and include that figure here. Also, please include a budget breakdown to specify how you are planning to spend these funds.
